# Devcard examples

A good way to get started with [devcards](https://github.com/igorhub/devcard) is to clone the this repo and to tinker with it.
This repo contains the set of examples that describe most of devcards' capabilities.


## Setup

First, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/igorhub/devcard-examples
```


Second, install the devcards web app:

```sh
go install github.com/igorhub/devcard/cmd/devcards@latest
```


Now, cd into `devcard-examples` and start the app:

```sh
cd devcard-examples
devcards
```


Open http://127.0.0.1:50051 and read through the devcards.

If you're just curious and not ready to install anything, you can read the rendered devcards at [github pages](https://igorhub.github.io/devcard-examples/).
